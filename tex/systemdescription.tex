\section{System Characterization}

\subsection{System Overview}

\paragraph{System mission}
The system is a photo sharing website that allows users to share images and comment on images.
The mission of the system is to satisfy certain functionality requirements and security requirements.

\paragraph{System architecture}
The website is being hosted on a machine running Ubuntu and is accessible through HTTP on port 80.
The machine is running an Apache web server with support for PHP and a MySQL database.
The website uses the server-side programming language PHP with user data and images stored in a MySQL database.


\subsection{System Functionality}
With respect to functionality, the site should support the registration as a new user or logging in as an existing user. 
Users must be able to do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Upload pictures. 
\item Share his own pictures with other named other users on a picture-by-picture basis.
\item View his own pictures and pictures other has shared with him.
\item Comment on any picture he can view.
\item View comments on any picture he can view.
\end{enumerate}
The security requirements are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Access control. A user is authorised for his own pictures and photo streams, and photo streams he has joined.
\item Confidentiality. Only a user authorised for a picture can view, comment or read comments on that picture.
\item Integrity. No user can modify any picture or comment.
\item Availability. No unauthorised user can prevent an image or a comment from being shown to authorised users.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Components and Subsystems}

\paragraph{Website files}

\paragraph{Database}
The system uses a MySQL database with four tables:

\begin{verbatim}
+----------------+
| Tables_in_ssas |

| image_shares   |
| images         |

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Backdoors}

\paragraph{Easy backdoor}
On port 5555 we have an echo server that will return the input.
If the input string is longer than 50 characters it will open a terminal as the root user.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run nmap to discover the echo service running on port 5555
	\item Run the following command from a terminal to connect: \texttt{nc <ip address> <port>}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Difficult backdoor}
The file index.php sends a cookie to the browser containing the credentials of the root user encrypted using Caesar cipher.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Navigate to the main page in a browser e.g. Google Chrome
	\item Press F12 to bring up the developer tools
	\item Navigate to Resources -> Cookies -> localhost
	\item The name of the cookie is the password of the root user, encrypted using Caesar cypher +10.
	\item Decrypt the password by replacing each letter with the one appearing 10 characters earlier in the English alphabet (all caps).
	\item Use the recovered password to log in to Ubuntu.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Risk Analysis and Security Measures}

\subsection{Assets}

The description of assets for the web service will be divided into two categories; physical assets and logical assets. The former category explains the tangible assets, such as computers and routers, while the latter concerns virtual or intangible assets (i.e. software, data objects and information). 


\subsection*{Physical Assets}

\setlist[description]{font=\normalfont\itshape}

\begin{description}
\item[Main computer] Computer running Linux on which LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is installed Access to the computer should be restricted to the system administrator. Both physical security precautions, such as locking the room where the computer is located, and digital precautions, i.e. requiring authentication needs to be adhered to.
 
\item[Router] The router to which the main computer connects to the internet. Like the main computer does access to the router have to be restricted to prevent an adversary from being able to control the router. 

\item[Server hosting web service] The web service is hosted from a virtual server in a location that we do not have control over. In the event that this server is compromised we need to be able to access the data located on it. Data from client to server must be encrypted and backup solutions of the data is necessary in order to ensure the integrity of the data objects and the availability of the service. 
 
\item[Local backup server]
We store a copy of the data on a server in the same building as the main computer. In the event that the web server is unavailable or attacked by an adversary we have fast and easy access to the content on it. Snapshots of the database content must be taken on at least a daily basis.  As with the main computer does this server require a physical lock and user authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Access should only be granted to the system administrator or senior technical support staff. 

\item[Web server storing backups]
We keep snapshots of the database on a web server in the case that the building housing the main computer and local backup server is compromised. This server is from a different provider than the server hosting the web service. Snapshots are taken in the same frequency as on the local backup server. 

\end{description}
	
\subsection*{Logical Assets}

\subsubsection*{Software}
This list explains the relevant software assets for the main computer and router. The state of these assets is described by the recency of software updates. The ideal state is that the software is up-to-date and changes when a new uninstalled version is available. the fequency of updating the software therefore important. 

\begin{description}
	\item[Main computer]
	The main computer runs Ubuntu (currently running version 14.04) and only contains a LAMP distribution with Apache, MySQL and PHP. The computer requires user authentication and is maintained by the system administrator who ensures that the latest updates are installed on a daily basis. 
	\item[Router firmware]
	The firmware of the router is kept up to date by the system administrator or a senior technical staff member. He or she is also obliged to maintain the firewall software in order to prevent possible exploits in out-of-date versions of the firmware of firewall software. 

\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Information}
This section describes the assets in form of data objects that are of value to the web services stakeholders.


\begin{description}
	\item[Images and comments] 
	The main component of the web service. Since the web service allows users to share images with each other we need to ensure that only agents with permission to access the images (and comments attached to those images) may be able to so. Likewise do we need to prevent users from writing comments to images that they are not authorized to view. The state space is comprised of the availability of access to the content as well as the set of agents that have legitimate access to the content. 
	
	\item[Username and passwords] 
	The integrity of the list of usernames and passwords of the web service's userbase should be guaranteed. The state space consist of the set of people with access to each username and password. The only item of this set should be the user who created the username and password. If this set changes the value of the state will significantly decrease.

\subsection{Threat Sources}

We describe and list the most probable and dangerous threat sources and associated threat actions. We perform this limitation as the list of \emph{all} possible threat sources is exhaustive and the risks of many threats are to small. 

\begin{description}

\item[Employees]
It is careless to that your employees will only act in the benefit of the company. Some employees might have malicious intentions and abuse their position to gain access to data that they should not be authorized to. The company therefore needs to consider the principle of least privilege. 

\item[Competitors]
By launching a web service one must expect that companies with competitive products will have an interest in gaining access to the data of this service or perhaps the source code that the service is build upon. 

\item[Script kiddies]
We expect that the threat of script kiddies is proportional to the popularity of the web service. This is because script kiddies may be motivated by the prestige element of hacking and the prestige of successfully hacking a highly popular service is higher than that of a lesser-known product.

\item[Hackers]

\item[Governmental agencies]
Because the web service contains ways for users to communicate with each other, it remains possible that it can be targeted by a governmental agency. Such agency could be concerned that the web service is used to by people with malicious intent, such as members of terrorist groups. End-to-end encryption of the content could help mitigate this threat. Despite the fact that we consider the possibility of this happening to be low, does the high computational power and skill set of people working in governmental agencies have a high impact on the security of the web service.
